Feature Engineered Variables
=============================
1. Timestamp - 
Day (Some days have more customers than others)
Month (Some months have more customers than others)
Date of Month (Some date of month have more customers than others)

Timestamp into absolute minutes =  Hr x 60 + Mins
e.g. 17:40 = 17 x 69 + 40

-- It might not vary linearly (Day and night may have different distributions)

2. Cluster latitudes and longtitudes. Use both pickup and drop

3. Use cluster numbers as extra feature
